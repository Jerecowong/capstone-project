# capstone-project
CourseBridge: a Tailored Coursera Course Recommender Based on Your Profile and a Job Posting

## Overview -- Project Proposals

During the course you will complete an individual capstone project that will serve as the key evidence for employers about what you're capable of building.

A few tips we've heard in the past from project reviewers
* Make sure the final of your project includes evidence of results (Blog w/ code snippets, iPython Notebook, or organized Github).
* Something about your project should be very challenging
* Your project should have plausible business value 
* Make your analysis novel


### Technology
* Chartio - make all kinds of charts
* Mortar
* yHat - host models
* Keen.io - back end for analytics apps
* Domino - run code on bigger hardware

## Proposals

Now that we've had so much fun with structured curriculum, it's time to shift gears into personal projects. These project proposals are meant to:
* Serve as a record for your ideas
* Allow ZA instructors to evaluate, critique, and provide feedback
* Simulate real-world scenarios where new data science initiatives require justification and defense

#### Preliminary-proposal

Preliminary proposals serve to oraganize all of your initial ideas and will allow us to provide feedback on each of them before you narrow it down to one... and it is always great to have backups!

Please follow the following template for your project proposals:

1. Name, Date.
2. High level description of the project: what question or problem are you addressing?
3. How are you presenting your work? (web app, visualization, presentation/slides, etc.)
4. Whats your next step?
5. What are your data sources? 

#### Final Proposal
For the final proposal, you will pick one of your initial ideas and elaborate on it.  In addition to everything listed in the preliminary proposal, please add the following:

1. Describe your techniques: break the data pipeline into portions and describe each one.
2. Can you anticipate problems, what are they, do you need to overcome them now? How do you overcome them?
3. How far do you anticipate to take the project in the allotted time frame? 
4. Any other repos, libraries and other tools that you're considering using? Are you citing them? Are you acknowledging them for their contribution?
5. Do you have the dataset already? If not, what is involved in obtaining it?
