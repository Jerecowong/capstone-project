Data Science Fellow 01/2015 – 03/2015
• Intensive boot camp program helping to establish the fundamentals needed for a data science
career in industry, including machine learning, advanced SQL, NLP, Hadoop and data
visualization. The topics covered include: linear regression, logistics regression, k-nearest
neighbors, decision trees, random forest, clustering, Bayesian (logistic and naive), hidden
Markov, boosting, natural language processing, support vector machines, neural networks,
dimensionality reduction, recommender, processing of A/B test, multi-arm bandit test, etc.
• Capstone project: CourseBridge
o Scraped all the information of all the courses offered by Coursera
o Implemented a Coursera course recommender based on resume and a job posting using
NLP and vector similarity techniques
o Delivered the project as a web app using Flask and pandasInnovative Interfaces Inc. Emeryville,CA

• Implemented and maintained one of the most popular web-based library systems (INNOPAC)
• Worked on the full-stack; collaborated closely with product management to build out customer
requirements, use-cases, and acceptance criteria for a Struts frame-worked web application to
edit bibliographic record
• Developed library catalog search web services; Library patron ratings and recommendation
features with Collaborative Filtering algorithm; Daily, Monthly and yearly statistics report based on
system logs; Library E-commerce product, etc.
