Work Experience
Sr. Associate Development Scientist
Bayer HealthCare - Berkeley, CA
February 2003 to September 2014
• Design and performance of upstream process development work; clone selection, shake flask evaluation, cell banking and scale up, bioreactor inoculation, operation, maintenance, and primary isolation 
• Perform numerous fed-batch and continuous fermentation experiments with mammalian cells (CHO, BHK) 
• Execute design of experiments (DOE) to determine suitable fermentation process parameter ranges, perform technology transfer to cGMP operations, hands-on setup and execution of cGMP continuous and fed-batch clinical campaigns to generate Phase I/III material, author internal reports summarizing development activities 
• Expert in the use of single-use bioreactors (SUBs) as a part of upstream development and clinical manufacturing 
• Co-led upstream team to develop the pilot implementation of a fully integrated electronic lab notebook (ELN) platform covering all development unit operations 
• Create and maintain fermentation templates for data entry, calculation of mass balances, cell specific rates, visualization and ease data export for further processing with software like JMP and Tableau 
• Design of bioreactor controllers for use in research and clinical environments, serve as primary contact with vendors and procurement to communicate requirements, review P&ID, perform Factory Acceptance Tests (FAT), ensure systems are delivered on time and operate as intended 
• Initiate a project utilizing PAT methodology to integrate an auto-sampler into fermenter control software and programmed an expert system to automate tasks, standardize decision making, and deliver consistent bioreactor performance 
• Supported conformance deviation investigations by providing SME support
